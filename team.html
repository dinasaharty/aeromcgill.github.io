        <h1> Design Teams </h1>
        
        <h2>SAE Aero Design: Micro</h2>
           <p>The SAE team designs and manufactures a miniature, remote-controlled, electric cargo-carrying airplane to compete in the Micro class of the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Aero Design Competition. The objective of the competition is for teams to design their airplane to carry the highest payload (“cargo”) relative to the airplane’s weight and size. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Developing a competitive airplane necessitates extensive knowledge in general mechanics, fluid flow & aerodynamics, computer-aided design, electronics, stability & control, and materials, among other engineering topics learned at school. The team will not rely on theory alone, and will carry out simulation, prototyping, and testing of all airplane systems to refine the airplane and ensure that it is a product capable of winning the competition. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The SAE Aero Design Competition (East) will take place in March in Lakeland, Florida. Seventy-five teams from around the world will gather to compete their airplanes and show them off to industrial representatives. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The airplanes will be scored not only on the results of flights, but on an oral design presentation and written design report, judged by industry experts. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The competition is an opportunity for us to see our hard work in action, learn from others, and ultimately vie to have the best aircraft. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
           </p>
           
           <h2>AHS Micro Air Vehicle</h2>
           
           <p>The AHS team designs and manufactures a semi-autonomous vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle to compete in the AHS (American Helicopter Society) Micro Air Vehicle competition in May in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the competition, teams are required to build a small autonomous or semiautonomous unmanned arial vehicle. The vehicle must demonstrate VTOL and sustained hover capabilities while searching for a target in an unspecified area through a course designated by AHS. All types of vertical flight methods are accepted so long as they utilize an electric motor. This competition is restricted to undergraduate students only.
            <br>
            <br>
            Apart from the aircraft design knowledge required to create this vehicle, a large part of the design work focuses on aspects such as control theory, stability, and computer vision.
            <br>
            <br>
            Designing a vehicle that can fly by itself and search for a target will provide many learning opportunities to the undergraduate students on the AHS team.
