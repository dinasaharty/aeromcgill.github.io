        <h1> How can you help? </h1>

         <p>  In order to provide funding for these design teams, the McGill Aerospace Design Society relies on the support of sponsorship partners. There are many costs associated with the conceptualization, manufacture, testing, and ultimately competition of the vehicles created by our design teams.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Design team budgets are worked out between the individual design teams and the McGill Aerospace Design Society, with external input from the McGill Institute for Aerospace Engineering (MIAE). Because of the very limited design team funding we receive from our university, we must turn to external sponsors to allow these design teams to continue. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We need to cover all design team costs, such as software, materials, components, advanced manufacturing, testing equipment, competition fees and transportation. The following is a breakdown of our estimated costs for the 2014-2015 academic year, comprising both the SAE and AHS design teams.
          <br>
          <br>
          As the AERO brand is unified among our design teams, sponsorship entails a partnership with all our design teams, giving more exposure to the sponsors. 
          <br>
          <br>
          To express our gratitude for your support, the following table describes what you can expect with a donation to the McGill Aerospace Design Society. Please discuss with us for alternatives, as we will strive to ensure the satisfaction of our sponsors. We can make arrangements for special sponsorship terms, such as designating funding to a particular design team. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Your support is what enables us to continue these aerospace design projects as extracurricular activities, providing innumerable learning and exploratory opportunities to the young engineers of the future.
          <br>
          <br>
          Support for the McGill Aerospace Design Society will facilitate the innumerable learning opportunities for McGill’s aspiring engineers. On AERO design teams, students are able to apply the concepts they learn in class to practical applications; they are able to experience every stage of the design process, from conceptualization to manufacturing and testing. Our members are passionate and creative, and share a collaborative spirit transcending individual design teams. 
          <br>
          <br>
          With your help, we hope to be able to grow AERO to match the demand for aerospace engineering design teams from McGill’s student body. Thank you for your support! 
          <br>
